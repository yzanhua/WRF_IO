## Parallel I/O Kernel Case Study -- WRF

This repository contains a case study of parallel I/O kernel from the
[WRF](https://https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF) climate simulation model.


The benchmark program in this repository is designed to evaluate the WRF I/O
kernel when using the above mentioned libraries to perform the I/O task.
